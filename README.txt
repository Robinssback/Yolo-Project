This model helps predict whether a plant/animal/human is present in a photo using a YOLO model. 
The dataset is from Kaggle; I don't recall the exact name.

Features
- Detects plants, animals, and humans in images.
- Outputs bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- Saves predictions as images and text files.
- Uses a custom-trained YOLO model.
